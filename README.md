## ☆ Emily’s epic mac and cheese ☆
### Notes:
-	This recipe uses a pressure cooker, I don’t know how you would cook it without one
-	All measurements are Australian metric, you will need to convert them to British or American or whatever you use
-	If you can, buy the cheese in blocks and shred it yourself, pre-shredded cheese has chemicals in it that stop it from sticking together which also make it not melt together properly
-	For the milk, start off with ½ a cup and slowly go up to 1 cup until you reach the desired consistency of the sauce

### Ingredients:
-	450g macaroni
-	1L chicken stock
-	30g butter
-	1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
-	1 teaspoon garlic powder
-	½ teaspoon pepper
-	½ teaspoon salt
-	450g shredded cheddar cheese
-	250g shredded mozzarella cheese
-	125g shredded parmesan cheese
-	½ to 1 cup of milk
-	Fresh parsley

### Instructions:
-	Put the macaroni, chicken stock, butter, hot sauce, garlic powder, salt and pepper in the pressure cooker
-	Close the lid and set to seal. Cook on manual, high pressure for 5 minutes, then release the pressure
-	Add ½ a cup of milk and add the cheese gradually in 3 to 4 handfuls, stirring in between each addition until smooth. If the sauce is too thick for your liking, slowly add up to another ½ a cup of milk until the sauce is the consistency you like
-	Top with parsley and serve ^w^

its open sauce haha
